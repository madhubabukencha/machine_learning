This will take a lot of time and computing resources, so it is typically done in offline. First the system is trained and then it launched into production and runs without learning anymore it just applies what it has learned. This is called offline learning.

Each learning step is fast and cheap, so the system can learn about new data on the fly as it arrives. Online learning is great for systems that receive data as a continuous flow and need to adapt to changes rapidly or autonomously. Online learning algorithms can also be used to train on big data that can't fit on one machine's main memory."
