    "    <li><i>Training sample</i>: A training sample is a data point x in an available training set that we use for tackling a predictive modeling task. <mark style=\"background-color: #ffb0b0;\">For example, if we are interested in classifying emails, one email in our dataset would be one training sample.</mark> Sometimes, people also use the synonymous terms  <mark style=\"background-color: #ffb0b0;\">training instance or training example.</mark></li><br>\n",
    "    <li><i>Target function</i>: In predictive modeling, we are typically interested in modeling a particular process; we want to learn or approximate a particular function that, for example, let's us distinguish spam from non-spam email. The target function f(x) = y is the true function f that we want to model.</li><br>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "      <i>Hypothesis</i>: A hypothesis is a certain function that we believe (or hope) is similar to the true function, the target function that we want to model. <mark style=\"background-color: #ffb0b0;\"> In context of email spam classification, it would be the rule we came up with that allows us to separate spam from non-spam emails</mark>\n",
    "    </li><br>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "    <i>Model</i>: In machine learning field, the terms hypothesis and model are often used interchangeably. In other sciences, they can have different meanings, <mark style=\"background-color: #ffb0b0;\">i.e., the hypothesis would be the \"educated guess\" by the scientist, and the model would be the manifestation of this guess that can be used to test the hypothesis.</mark>\n",
    "    </li> <br>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        <i>Learning algorithm</i>: Again, our goal is to find or approximate the target function, and the learning algorithm is a set of instructions that tries to model the target function using our training dataset. <mark style=\"background-color: #ffb0b0;\">A learning algorithm comes with a hypothesis space, the set of possible hypotheses it can come up with in order to model the unknown target function by formulating the final hypothesis</mark>\n",

    "        <i>Classifier</i>: A classifier is a special case of a hypothesis (nowadays, often learned by a machine learning algorithm). A classifier is a hypothesis or discrete-valued function that is used to assign (categorical) class labels to particular data points. In the email classification example, this classifier could be a hypothesis for labeling emails as spam or non-spam. However, a hypothesis must not necessarily be synonymous to a classifier. In a different application, our hypothesis could be a function for mapping study time and educational backgrounds of students to their future SAT scores.\n",
